
## 1. **Basic Network Information**  

- **ifconfig**: Displays or configures network interfaces (deprecated, replaced by `ip` in newer distros).  
  ```sh
  ifconfig        # Shows all active network interfaces
  ifconfig eth0   # Displays details for the eth0 interface
  ```

- **ip**: More advanced tool for network management, replacing `ifconfig`.  
  ```sh
  ip a            # Shows all IP addresses and interfaces
  ip link show    # Displays link-layer information
  ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0   # Assigns an IP address to eth0
  ip addr del 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0   # Removes the IP address from eth0
  ip link set eth0 up   # Brings the interface up
  ip link set eth0 down # Brings the interface down
  ```

- **hostname**: Shows or sets the system's hostname.  
  ```sh
  hostname           # Shows the current hostname
  hostnamectl set-hostname new-name   # Sets a new hostname (modern systems)
  ```

## 2. **Network Testing and Troubleshooting**  

- **ping**: Tests connectivity to another network device using ICMP packets.  
  ```sh
  ping google.com         # Pings Google's server
  ping -c 4 google.com    # Sends 4 ping packets
  ping -i 0.5 google.com  # Sets interval between packets to 0.5 seconds
  ```

- **traceroute**: Traces the route packets take to a network host.  
  ```sh
  traceroute google.com   # Shows the path packets take to reach Google
  ```

- **tracepath**: Similar to traceroute but does not require superuser privileges.  
  ```sh
  tracepath google.com
  ```

- **mtr**: Combines `ping` and `traceroute` for real-time analysis.  
  ```sh
  mtr google.com          # Interactive network diagnostics
  ```

- **nslookup**: Queries DNS records.  
  ```sh
  nslookup google.com     # Looks up the IP address of a domain
  ```

- **dig**: More advanced DNS lookup tool.  
  ```sh
  dig google.com          # Retrieves detailed DNS information
  dig google.com +short   # Shows only the IP addresses
  dig @8.8.8.8 google.com # Queries a specific DNS server (Google's public DNS)
  ```

## 3. **Routing and Gateway Management**  

- **route**: Displays or modifies routing tables (deprecated, replaced by `ip route`).  
  ```sh
  route -n                 # Displays the routing table in numeric format
  route add default gw 192.168.1.1 eth0   # Sets the default gateway
  ```

- **ip route**: Manages routing tables (modern replacement for `route`).  
  ```sh
  ip route show                    # Displays current routing table
  ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0   # Adds a default gateway
  ip route del default              # Deletes the default route
  ```

---

## 4. **Name Resolution and Caching**  

- **host**: Looks up DNS details.  
  ```sh
  host google.com                  # Resolves domain to IP address
  host 8.8.8.8                     # Resolves IP to domain name
  ```

- **systemd-resolve**: Queries and controls systemd-resolved DNS settings.  
  ```sh
  systemd-resolve --status         # Displays DNS status and cache
  systemd-resolve google.com       # Checks the DNS resolution for a domain
  ```

- **resolvectl**: Replacement for `systemd-resolve` in newer systems.  
  ```sh
  resolvectl status                # Shows DNS resolution status
  resolvectl query google.com      # Queries DNS for the domain
  ```

---

## 5. **Data Transfer and Connection Testing**  

- **curl**: Transfers data from or to a server using various protocols.  
  ```sh
  curl https://example.com              # Downloads a webpage
  curl -I https://example.com            # Fetches HTTP headers only
  curl -O https://example.com/file.txt   # Downloads a file with the same name
  ```

- **wget**: Retrieves files from the web.  
  ```sh
  wget https://example.com/file.zip      # Downloads a file
  wget -c https://example.com/file.zip   # Resumes an interrupted download
  ```

- **nc (netcat)**: Reads and writes data across network connections.  
  ```sh
  nc -l -p 1234             # Listens on port 1234 for incoming connections
  nc example.com 80         # Connects to example.com on port 80
  ```

---

## 6. **Network Monitoring and Analysis**  

- **netstat**: Displays network connections, routing tables, and more (deprecated, replaced by `ss`).  
  ```sh
  netstat -tuln               # Lists open ports and services
  netstat -anp                # Shows active connections with process IDs
  ```

- **ss**: More advanced utility for network statistics.  
  ```sh
  ss -tuln                    # Shows listening ports
  ss -anp                     # Shows all network connections and processes
  ```

- **tcpdump**: Captures and analyzes network packets.  
  ```sh
  tcpdump -i eth0             # Captures traffic on eth0
  tcpdump -i eth0 port 80     # Captures HTTP traffic
  tcpdump -w capture.pcap     # Saves captured packets to a file
  ```

- **iftop**: Displays real-time bandwidth usage per connection.  
  ```sh
  iftop -i eth0               # Monitors traffic on eth0
  ```

- **nload**: Visualizes incoming and outgoing network traffic.  
  ```sh
  nload eth0                  # Monitors eth0 traffic in real-time
  ```

## 7. **Network Services and Ports**  

- **nmap**: Network scanner and security auditing tool.  
  ```sh
  nmap 192.168.1.1            # Scans a specific host for open ports
  nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24     # Ping scan for active hosts in a subnet
  nmap -A example.com         # Performs a detailed scan including OS detection
  ```

- **telnet**: Connects to remote servers using TCP (useful for testing open ports).  
  ```sh
  telnet example.com 80       # Connects to example.com on port 80
  ```

- **ssh**: Secure Shell for remote server management.  
  ```sh
  ssh user@remote-server      # Connects to a remote server securely
  ssh -i key.pem user@server  # Connects using an SSH key
  ```

## Notes:  
- Some commands require superuser privileges (use `sudo`).  
- `ifconfig` and `netstat` are deprecated in many distrosâ€”use `ip` and `ss` instead.  
- You may need to install certain tools:  
  ```sh
  sudo apt install nmap net-tools tcpdump iftop nload
  ```  
- **Man pages and help**: Use `man <command>` or `<command> --help` for more details.
