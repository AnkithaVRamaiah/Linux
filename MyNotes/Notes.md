# What is Internet?

"When we search for something on Google or open a website like **google.com**, we use the **internet**. Internet Service Providers (**ISPs**) like Airtel and Jio help us connect to the internet. However, computers do not understand names like 'google.com'; they only recognize numbers called **IP addresses**.  

So, when we type **google.com** in a browser, our computer first contacts a system called **DNS (Domain Name System)** to find the IP address of google.com. The **DNS searches for the correct IP address** and sends it back to our computer. Once our computer receives the IP address, it connects to **Google’s server**, and the website loads in our browser."

# What is server?

"A **server** is a computer that stores websites, apps, and files. It responds to requests from other computers, which are called **clients**.  

For example, when I type **www.youtube.com** in my browser, my browser sends a **request** to the YouTube server. This server stores YouTube’s web pages. When the server receives my request, it finds the webpage and sends it back to my computer so I can see it.  

### How does a server work?  
1. My computer (the client) sends a request to the server.  
2. The server finds the data I asked for.  
3. Instead of sending all the data at once, it is **broken into smaller pieces** called **packets**.  
4. These packets travel through the internet and reach my device.  
5. My computer **reassembles the packets** to display the webpage correctly.  

This process happens very quickly, so we don’t notice the delay. This is how a server works!"

# **Types of Servers**  
There are two main types of servers: **Web Server** and **Application Server**.  

#### **1. Web Server**  
A **web server** is responsible for storing and delivering **static content**, meaning content that does not change often. For example, when you open **google.com**, the web server sends you Google’s homepage. This homepage is a **pre-built page** that looks the same for everyone and does not change frequently.  

#### **2. Application Server**  
An **application server** handles **dynamic content**, meaning content that changes based on user input.  

- For example, when you log in to **Facebook**, the application server checks your **username and password** in the database. Then, it retrieves your **personal feed** and sends you a **customized webpage**.  
- Similarly, when you search for something on **YouTube**, the application server fetches video results from the database and displays them based on your search.  

In simple terms:  
- **Web servers** deliver **static pages** that do not change frequently.  
- **Application servers** process **user requests** and deliver **dynamic content** based on data from a database.
