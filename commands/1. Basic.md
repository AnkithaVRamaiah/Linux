### **Basic Linux Commands for DevOps**  
As a DevOps engineer, you’ll use Linux commands daily for tasks like managing files, monitoring systems, and automating scripts. Here are the essential commands to get you started:  

---

### **1. Navigating the File System**  
- **`ls`** – List directory contents.  
  ```bash
  ls         # List files in current directory
  ls -l      # Detailed list with permissions, owner, size, and date
  ls -a      # Include hidden files
  ls -lh     # Human-readable file sizes
  ```
- **`cd`** – Change directory.  
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/directory  # Go to a specific directory
  cd ..                  # Move up one directory
  cd ~                   # Go to home directory
  ```
- **`pwd`** – Print working directory (shows the current location).  
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```

---

### **2. File Operations**  
- **`touch`** – Create an empty file.  
  ```bash
  touch filename.txt
  ```
- **`cat`** – View file contents.  
  ```bash
  cat filename.txt
  ```
- **`nano`** or **`vim`** – Edit files from the terminal.  
  ```bash
  nano filename.txt   # Easy to use text editor
  vim filename.txt    # Powerful editor but with a learning curve
  ```
- **`cp`** – Copy files or directories.  
  ```bash
  cp source.txt destination.txt      # Copy file
  cp -r /source/directory /destination  # Copy directory and contents
  ```
- **`mv`** – Move or rename files.  
  ```bash
  mv oldname.txt newname.txt
  mv file.txt /new/location/          # Move to another directory
  ```
- **`rm`** – Delete files or directories.  
  ```bash
  rm filename.txt       # Delete file
  rm -r directoryname   # Delete directory and its contents
  rm -f filename.txt    # Force delete without confirmation
  ```

---

### **3. Directory Operations**  
- **`mkdir`** – Create a new directory.  
  ```bash
  mkdir new_directory
  mkdir -p parent/child/grandchild  # Create nested directories
  ```
- **`rmdir`** – Remove an empty directory.  
  ```bash
  rmdir directory_name
  ```

---

### **4. File Permissions and Ownership**  
- **`ls -l`** – View file permissions.  
- **`chmod`** – Change file permissions.  
  ```bash
  chmod 755 filename.sh   # Owner: read, write, execute; Others: read, execute
  chmod +x script.sh      # Make a script executable
  ```
- **`chown`** – Change file owner or group.  
  ```bash
  sudo chown user:group filename.txt
  ```

---

### **5. Searching and Filtering**  
- **`grep`** – Search text in files.  
  ```bash
  grep "search_text" filename.txt
  grep -i "search_text" filename.txt  # Case insensitive search
  grep -r "search_text" /path/to/search  # Recursive search in directory
  ```
- **`find`** – Locate files and directories.  
  ```bash
  find /path/to/search -name "filename.txt"
  find /path/to/search -type d -name "foldername"  # Search for directories
  ```
- **`locate`** – Quickly find files by name.  
  ```bash
  locate filename.txt
  ```

---

### **6. System Monitoring and Management**  
- **`top`** – Real-time view of running processes.  
- **`htop`** – An improved version of `top` (requires installation).  
- **`ps`** – View active processes.  
  ```bash
  ps aux           # List all running processes
  ps -ef | grep process_name  # Search for a specific process
  ```
- **`kill`** – Terminate a process.  
  ```bash
  kill PID         # Send SIGTERM (safe termination)
  kill -9 PID      # Force kill (SIGKILL)
  ```
- **`df`** – Check disk space usage.  
  ```bash
  df -h            # Human-readable disk space usage
  ```
- **`du`** – Check directory size.  
  ```bash
  du -sh /path/to/directory
  ```

---

### **7. Networking Commands**  
- **`ping`** – Check network connectivity.  
  ```bash
  ping google.com
  ```
- **`ifconfig`** or **`ip`** – View network interfaces and IP addresses.  
  ```bash
  ifconfig           # Older command
  ip a               # Newer version to check IP addresses
  ```
- **`nslookup`** – DNS lookup.  
  ```bash
  nslookup example.com
  ```
- **`netstat`** – View network connections, routing tables, and statistics.

  ssh user@remote_server_ip
  ```
- **`scp`** – Securely copy files between systems.  
  ```bash
  scp localfile.txt user@remote_ip:/remote/path/
  ```

### **8. Package Management**  
- **For Ubuntu/Debian (apt):**  
  ```bash
  sudo apt update             # Update package list
  sudo apt upgrade            # Upgrade installed packages
  sudo apt install package_name  # Install a package
  sudo apt remove package_name   # Uninstall a package
  ```
- **For CentOS/Red Hat (yum or dnf):**  
  ```bash
  sudo yum update
  sudo yum install package_name
  sudo yum remove package_name
  ```

### **9. System Information**  
- **`uname`** – Display system information.  
  ```bash
  uname -a          # Show all system information
  uname -r          # Show kernel version
  ```
- **`hostname`** – Show or set the system hostname.  
- **`whoami`** – Display the current username.  
- **`history`** – Show command history.

### **10. File Compression and Archiving**  
- **`tar`** – Archive multiple files into one.  
  ```bash
  tar -cvf archive.tar file1 file2  # Create an archive
  tar -xvf archive.tar              # Extract an archive
  tar -czvf archive.tar.gz folder   # Create compressed archive
  tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz          # Extract compressed archive
  ```
- **`gzip`** and **`gunzip`** – Compress and decompress files.
