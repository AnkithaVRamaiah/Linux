### **What is Application Support?**

Imagine you’re using an app, and it suddenly stops working or has an issue. **Application support** is like the help desk for that app. The support team helps you figure out what went wrong and fixes it, whether it’s a technical problem or something simple like not knowing how to use a feature.

- **Example**: If your phone's email app isn't sending emails, the support team helps you solve the problem, whether it's an app bug or a setting you missed.

### **What is Application Maintenance?**

Now, even after an app is working well, **maintenance** is what keeps it running smoothly over time. Just like how your phone needs updates to work better, applications also need updates to improve, fix bugs, or add new features.

- **Example**: If your email app gets a new design, faster loading, or new features like better search, that’s **maintenance**—they’re keeping the app up to date.

### **Difference Between Support and Maintenance**  
- **Support** is helping when something goes wrong and fixing it.
- **Maintenance** is improving the app, fixing issues that aren’t urgent, and making sure it continues working well.

### **Real-Life Example**  

Think of an **app** as a **car**:
- **Support** is like going to a mechanic when your car breaks down, or when it’s not working right (e.g., the engine isn't starting).
- **Maintenance** is like getting your car’s oil changed, cleaning it, and upgrading the sound system over time so it continues to run smoothly and better.

### **Why Does This Matter?**

- **Support** ensures the app **works correctly** and fixes problems.
- **Maintenance** ensures the app stays **up-to-date** and continues to meet your needs.
