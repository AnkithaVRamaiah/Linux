### **File Permission Commands in Linux**  
File permissions in Linux control who can read, write, or execute files and directories. Here’s how to manage them:

---

## **1. Viewing Permissions**  
- **`ls -l`** – Lists files with detailed permissions.  
  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```
  Example output:  
  ```
  -rwxr-xr--  1 owner group 4096 Jan 1 10:00 script.sh
  ```
  Breakdown:  
  - `-` → File type (`-` for files, `d` for directories)  
  - `rwx` → **Owner** permissions (Read, Write, Execute)  
  - `r-x` → **Group** permissions (Read, Execute)  
  - `r--` → **Others** permissions (Read only)  

---

## **2. Changing Permissions with `chmod`**  
### **Symbolic Mode**  
- **Syntax:**  
  ```bash
  chmod [who][operation][permission] filename
  ```
  - `who`: `u` (User/Owner), `g` (Group), `o` (Others), `a` (All)  
  - `operation`: `+` (Add), `-` (Remove), `=` (Set exactly)  
  - `permission`: `r` (Read), `w` (Write), `x` (Execute)  

- **Examples:**  
  ```bash
  chmod u+x filename       # Add execute permission to owner
  chmod g-w filename       # Remove write permission from group
  chmod o+r filename       # Add read permission for others
  chmod a-x filename       # Remove execute permission for all
  chmod ug+x filename      # Add execute permission to owner and group
  chmod o=rw filename      # Set read and write permission for others
  ```

---

### **Numeric Mode**  
Permissions are represented by numbers:  
- `4` = Read (`r`)  
- `2` = Write (`w`)  
- `1` = Execute (`x`)  

Combine these numbers for each group (Owner, Group, Others).  
- **Syntax:**  
  ```bash
  chmod [owner][group][others] filename
  ```

- **Examples:**  
  ```bash
  chmod 755 script.sh
  chmod 644 document.txt
  chmod 700 private_file
  chmod 777 public_file
  ```
  Explanation of `755`:  
  - `7` = Owner: `rwx` → `4+2+1 = 7`  
  - `5` = Group: `r-x` → `4+0+1 = 5`  
  - `5` = Others: `r-x` → `4+0+1 = 5`

## **3. Recursive Permissions**  
- **Change permissions for all files and directories within a folder:**  
  ```bash
  chmod -R 755 directory_name
  ```

---

## **4. Changing Ownership with `chown`**  
- **Change File Owner:**  
  ```bash
  sudo chown newowner filename
  ```
- **Change Owner and Group:**  
  ```bash
  sudo chown newowner:newgroup filename
  ```
- **Change Group Only:**  
  ```bash
  sudo chgrp newgroup filename
  ```
- **Recursive Ownership Change:**  
  ```bash
  sudo chown -R newowner:newgroup directory_name
  ```

---

## **5. Special Permissions**  
- **SetUID (`s` on owner’s execute):**  
  - Executes a program with the permissions of the file owner.  
  ```bash
  chmod u+s filename
  ```
- **SetGID (`s` on group’s execute):**  
  - Files created in the directory inherit the group of the directory.  
  ```bash
  chmod g+s directory_name
  ```
- **Sticky Bit (`t` on others’ execute):**  
  - Only the file owner can delete files in the directory. Common in `/tmp`.  
  ```bash
  chmod +t directory_name
  ```

---

## **6. Checking Special Permissions**  
```bash
ls -l
```
Example output with special permissions:  
```
-rwsr-xr-x  1 root root 12345 Jan 1 10:00 su
drwxrwsr-x  2 user devs 4096 Jan 1 10:00 shared_dir
drwxrwxrwt  2 user users 4096 Jan 1 10:00 temp_dir
```
- `s` → SetUID or SetGID  
- `t` → Sticky Bit  

---

## **7. Practical Examples**  
- **Make a Script Executable:**  
  ```bash
  chmod +x script.sh
  ```
- **Make a Directory Readable and Executable by Everyone:**  
  ```bash
  chmod 755 directory_name
  ```
- **Give Full Permissions to Owner, Read and Execute to Group and Others:**  
  ```bash
  chmod 755 filename
  ```
- **Secure a Private File (Only Owner Can Read and Write):**  
  ```bash
  chmod 600 private_file
  ```
- **Share a Directory Among Group Members:**  
  ```bash
  chown :groupname shared_directory
  chmod 2775 shared_directory  # SetGID to inherit group ownership
  ```

## **Summary:**  
- **Viewing Permissions:** `ls -l`  
- **Changing Permissions:** `chmod`  
  - **Symbolic Mode:** (`u`, `g`, `o`, `a` with `+`, `-`, `=`)  
  - **Numeric Mode:** (`r=4`, `w=2`, `x=1`)  
- **Changing Ownership:** `chown` and `chgrp`  
- **Special Permissions:** `SetUID`, `SetGID`, and `Sticky Bit`
