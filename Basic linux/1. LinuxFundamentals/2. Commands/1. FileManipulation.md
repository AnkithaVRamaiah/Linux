### 1. **File Manipulation Commands:**

These commands allow you to manage and work with files and directories.

- **`ls`** – List directory contents
  - Shows files and directories within a specified directory.
  - Usage: `ls [options] [directory]`
  - Example: `ls -l` (detailed list with permissions and sizes), `ls -a` (includes hidden files).
  
- **`cd`** – Change Directory
  - Changes your current working directory.
  - Usage: `cd [directory_name]`
  - Example: `cd /home/user/` (moves to the specified directory), `cd ..` (goes up one directory level).

- **`pwd`** – Print Working Directory
  - Displays the current directory you are in.
  - Usage: `pwd`
  - Example: `/home/user`

- **`touch`** – Create an empty file
  - Creates a new, empty file.
  - Usage: `touch [filename]`
  - Example: `touch newfile.txt` (creates a new file named "newfile.txt").

- **`cp`** – Copy files or directories
  - Copies files or directories to a new location.
  - Usage: `cp [source] [destination]`
  - Example: `cp file1.txt /home/user/` (copies "file1.txt" to the specified directory).

- **`mv`** – Move or rename files or directories
  - Moves a file to a new location or renames it.
  - Usage: `mv [source] [destination]`
  - Example: `mv oldfile.txt newfile.txt` (renames a file).

- **`rm`** – Remove files or directories
  - Deletes files or directories.
  - Usage: `rm [file_name]`
  - Example: `rm file1.txt` (removes "file1.txt").

- **`find`** – Search for files
