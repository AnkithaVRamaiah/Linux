Here are all the essential Linux networking commands explained in a **simple and easy-to-understand way**. I'll break them down into categories to make them easier to learn and remember.  

---

## 1. **Basic Network Information**  

These commands help you see or change your computer's network settings.  

### **ifconfig** (Old Command)  
- Shows details about your network connections, like IP addresses.  
- Not used in newer Linux versions (use `ip` instead).  
```sh
ifconfig                 # Shows all network connections and their details
ifconfig eth0            # Shows details for the eth0 connection
```

### **ip** (New Command, Replaces `ifconfig`)  
- Shows and manages network settings.  
```sh
ip a                     # Shows all IP addresses and network connections
ip link show             # Shows status (on or off) of all connections
ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0   # Adds this IP to eth0
ip addr del 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0   # Removes the IP from eth0
ip link set eth0 up      # Turns on the eth0 connection
ip link set eth0 down    # Turns off the eth0 connection
```

### **hostname**  
- Shows or changes the computerâ€™s name on the network.  
```sh
hostname                 # Shows the current computer name
hostnamectl set-hostname new-name  # Changes the computer name to "new-name"
```

## 2. **Network Testing and Troubleshooting**  

These commands check if a device is connected or to find where the connection is slow.  

### **ping**  
- Checks if another computer or website is reachable.  
```sh
ping google.com          # Checks if Google's server is reachable
ping -c 4 google.com     # Sends 4 test messages and then stops
ping -i 0.5 google.com   # Sends a test message every 0.5 seconds
```

### **traceroute**  
- Shows the path your data takes to reach another computer or website.  
- Helps find where the connection is slow.  
```sh
traceroute google.com    # Shows the route to Google's server
```

### **tracepath**  
- Similar to `traceroute` but easier to use and doesn't need admin rights.  
```sh
tracepath google.com     # Shows the path to Google's server
```

### **mtr**  
- Combines `ping` and `traceroute` to give real-time updates on the connection.  
```sh
mtr google.com           # Shows live route and connection speed
```

### **nslookup**  
- Finds the IP address of a website or domain name.  
```sh
nslookup google.com      # Shows the IP address for google.com
```

### **dig**  
- Advanced version of `nslookup`, used for detailed domain info.  
```sh
dig google.com           # Shows detailed info about google.com
dig google.com +short    # Shows only the IP address
dig @8.8.8.8 google.com  # Uses Google's DNS server for the lookup
```

## 3. **Routing and Gateway Management**  

These commands control the path your data takes on the network.  

### **route** (Old Command)  
- Shows or changes the path data takes to reach other devices.  
- Replaced by `ip route` in modern Linux versions.  
```sh
route -n                 # Shows the current routing table
route add default gw 192.168.1.1 eth0   # Sets the main gateway for eth0
```

### **ip route** (New Command, Replaces `route`)  
- Manages the routing table, which controls how data travels.  
```sh
ip route show                    # Shows current routes
ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0   # Sets the main gateway
ip route del default              # Removes the main gateway
```

## 4. **Name Resolution and Caching**  

These commands find IP addresses from domain names.  

### **host**  
- Looks up the IP address for a domain.  
```sh
host google.com                 # Shows the IP address for google.com
host 8.8.8.8                    # Shows the domain name for this IP
```

### **systemd-resolve**  
- Checks or controls DNS settings.  
```sh
systemd-resolve --status        # Shows DNS settings and cache
systemd-resolve google.com      # Checks the IP address for google.com
```

### **resolvectl** (Newer Command)  
- Replaces `systemd-resolve` in some Linux versions.  
```sh
resolvectl status               # Shows DNS settings and cache
resolvectl query google.com     # Checks the IP address for google.com
```

## 5. **Data Transfer and Connection Testing**  

These commands help download files or check if a server is reachable.  

### **curl**  
- Gets data from a website or server.  
```sh
curl https://example.com              # Shows the content of the webpage
curl -I https://example.com            # Shows only the website's headers
curl -O https://example.com/file.txt   # Downloads a file
```

### **wget**  
- Downloads files from the internet.  
```sh
wget https://example.com/file.zip      # Downloads the file
wget -c https://example.com/file.zip   # Resumes a paused download
```

### **nc (netcat)**  
- Sends or receives data over the network, useful for testing.  
```sh
nc -l -p 1234              # Listens on port 1234 for incoming data
nc example.com 80          # Connects to example.com on port 80
```

## 6. **Network Monitoring and Analysis**  

These commands show details about network connections and usage.  

### **netstat** (Old Command)  
- Shows active connections and open ports.  
- Replaced by `ss` in modern Linux versions.  
```sh
netstat -tuln               # Shows open ports and services
netstat -anp                # Shows all connections and their processes
```

### **ss** (New Command, Replaces `netstat`)  
- Shows more detailed network connection info.  
```sh
ss -tuln                    # Shows listening ports
ss -anp                     # Shows all connections and programs using them
```

### **tcpdump**  
- Captures and shows network packets (useful for debugging).  
```sh
tcpdump -i eth0             # Captures packets on eth0
tcpdump -i eth0 port 80     # Captures HTTP packets only
tcpdump -w capture.pcap     # Saves packets to a file for later analysis
```

### **iftop**  
- Shows real-time bandwidth usage per connection.  
```sh
iftop -i eth0               # Monitors traffic on eth0
```

### **nload**  
- Visualizes incoming and outgoing network traffic.  
```sh
nload eth0                  # Shows traffic on eth0 in real-time
```

## 7. **Network Services and Ports**  

These commands scan and test open ports and services.  

### **nmap**  
- Scans networks to find devices and open ports.  
```sh
nmap 192.168.1.1            # Scans this IP for open ports
nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24     # Scans the entire network for active devices
nmap -A example.com         # Detailed scan with OS detection
```

### **telnet**  
- Checks if a port is open on a remote server.  
```sh
telnet example.com 80       # Connects to example.com on port 80
```

### **ssh**  
- Securely connects to remote servers.  
```sh
ssh user@remote-server      # Connects to a remote server
ssh -i key.pem user@server  # Connects using an SSH key
```

## **Notes:**  
- Some commands require **superuser** permissions, so use `sudo` if needed.  
- `ifconfig`, `netstat`, and `route` are **old commands**. Use `ip` and `ss` instead.  
- To **install missing tools**:  
```sh
sudo apt install nmap net-tools tcpdump iftop nload
```  
- Learn more with:  
```sh
man <command>     # Shows the manual page for the command
<command> --help  # Shows a brief guide on how to use the command
```
