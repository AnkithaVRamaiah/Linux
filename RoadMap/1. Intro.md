### **What is Linux?**  
Linux is an **operating system** just like Windows or macOS. It acts as a bridge between your computer's hardware and the applications you use. It manages the computer's resources, like memory and storage, and allows multiple programs to run at the same time.  

What makes Linux different is that it's **open source**, meaning anyone can view, modify, and share its code. This makes it highly **customizable, secure, and free** to use. Because of this, Linux is widely used on servers, smartphones (like Android), and even in supercomputers.

### **History of Linux**  
Linux was created by **Linus Torvalds** in **1991**. He wanted a free alternative to the expensive UNIX operating systems available at the time.  
He made his code public, allowing developers worldwide to contribute and improve it.  
Since then, Linux has grown into a powerful and reliable operating system used everywhere—from personal computers to servers and even space missions!
