# What is Internet?

"When we search for something on Google or open a website like **google.com**, we use the **internet**. Internet Service Providers (**ISPs**) like Airtel and Jio help us connect to the internet. However, computers do not understand names like 'google.com'; they only recognize numbers called **IP addresses**.  

So, when we type **google.com** in a browser, our computer first contacts a system called **DNS (Domain Name System)** to find the IP address of google.com. The **DNS searches for the correct IP address** and sends it back to our computer. Once our computer receives the IP address, it connects to **Google’s server**, and the website loads in our browser."

# What is server?

"A **server** is a computer that stores websites, apps, and files. It responds to requests from other computers, which are called **clients**.  

For example, when I type **www.youtube.com** in my browser, my browser sends a **request** to the YouTube server. This server stores YouTube’s web pages. When the server receives my request, it finds the webpage and sends it back to my computer so I can see it.  

### How does a server work?  
1. My computer (the client) sends a request to the server.  
2. The server finds the data I asked for.  
3. Instead of sending all the data at once, it is **broken into smaller pieces** called **packets**.  
4. These packets travel through the internet and reach my device.  
5. My computer **reassembles the packets** to display the webpage correctly.  

This process happens very quickly, so we don’t notice the delay. This is how a server works!"

# **Web Server and Application Server:**

There are two main types of servers: **web servers** and **application servers**.

1. **Web Server:**
   - A **web server** is responsible for delivering **static content** over the internet. **Static content** means the files that don’t change often, such as **HTML pages, images, videos, and CSS files**.  
   - For example, when you type **google.com** in your browser, the **web server** sends the Google homepage, which is a static **HTML file**. This page is **static**, meaning it stays the same unless the website owner updates it on the server.

2. **Application Server:**
   - An **application server** handles **dynamic content**, which means the content changes based on user interactions.  
   - For example, when you log into **Instagram**, the application server asks for your **username and password**. It checks the database to verify your details. Once verified, it generates a **customized homepage** for you, displaying your personalized feed.
   - If a different user logs in, the application server will generate a **different feed** based on their data. This is **dynamic content**, which means it changes based on the user's request or activity.

### **What is Linux?**

**Linux** is an **operating system**. An operating system is software that helps you interact with your computer. It is like **Windows** or **macOS**. 

Think of it like a bridge between your **computer hardware** (like the screen, keyboard, CPU, etc.) and the software (like apps or programs you use on your computer). It makes sure everything works together smoothly.

### **Why Linux?**

1. **Security**:  
   Linux is **more secure** than Windows. It's less likely to get viruses or other attacks because of how it is built.

2. **Customizable**:  
   You can change almost anything on Linux to make it work the way you want. It’s great for people who like to have control over their system, like developers.

3. **Free and Open Source**:  
   Linux is **free to use**. You don’t need to pay for it. Plus, it’s **open source**, meaning anyone can look at the code and even improve it if they want.

4. **Updates**:  
   Linux gets **regular updates** to make it work better and fix any issues. These updates happen less often compared to Windows and are easy to install.

5. **User-Friendliness**:  
   While Windows is easier for regular people, Linux is **better for those who need control** or care about **security**. It is a bit more technical but powerful.

6. **Multiple Users**:  
   **Many people** can use Linux on the same computer at the same time without any problems. This is useful for businesses or servers.

7. **Software Alternatives**:  
   Linux doesn’t run many **Windows programs**. But, it has **free alternatives** for most of them. For example, you can use **LibreOffice** instead of Microsoft Office.

8. **Great for Developers**:  
   Linux is popular with **developers** because it has lots of tools for coding and building web applications. It is also widely used for **web servers**.
