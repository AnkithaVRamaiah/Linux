### 1. **Top**
- **What it is**: `top` is one of the most common tools used to monitor system processes in real time.
- **How to use**:
  - Type `top` in the terminal.
  - Displays real-time information about CPU usage, memory usage, process IDs, and more.
  - You can press `q` to exit.
  - Press `1` to view per-core CPU usage.

### 2. **Htop**
- **What it is**: `htop` is an enhanced version of `top`. It is more user-friendly and has a graphical interface (with color).
- **How to install**: 
  ```
  sudo apt-get install htop  # For Debian-based systems
  sudo yum install htop      # For Red Hat-based systems
  ```
- **How to use**:
  - Type `htop` in the terminal.
  - Displays processes, CPU usage, memory usage, etc.
  - Use the arrow keys to scroll and `F10` to exit.
  - Press `F6` to sort by different columns (e.g., CPU, memory).

### 3. **Vmstat (Virtual Memory Statistics)**
- **What it is**: `vmstat` provides information about system memory, processes, paging, block IO, traps, and CPU activity.
- **How to use**:
  - Type `vmstat` in the terminal to display overall system health.
  - Example:
    ```
    vmstat 1
    ```
    This updates the system stats every second.
- **Key columns**:
  - `procs`: Information about running processes.
  - `memory`: Memory stats like free, used, swap.
  - `cpu`: CPU usage stats (user, system, idle time).

### 4. **Iostat (Input/Output Statistics)**
- **What it is**: `iostat` helps to monitor system input/output device and CPU performance.
- **How to install**:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install sysstat
  ```
- **How to use**:
  - Type `iostat` in the terminal.
  - Displays stats about CPU usage and disk IO.
  - Example:
    ```
    iostat -x 1
    ```
    This shows extended stats every second.

### 5. **Netstat (Network Statistics)**
- **What it is**: `netstat` provides detailed information about network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, etc.
- **How to use**:
  - Type `netstat` to show all active connections.
  - Example:
    ```
    netstat -tuln
    ```
    Shows listening TCP/UDP ports without resolving hostnames.
- **Other options**:
  - `-a`: All connections and listening ports.
  - `-r`: Show the routing table.
  - `-i`: Display network interfaces.

### 6. **Ss (Socket Stat)** 
- **What it is**: `ss` is a modern replacement for `netstat`. Itâ€™s faster and provides more detailed network information.
- **How to use**:
  - Type `ss` to see network connections.
  - Example:
    ```
    ss -tuln
    ```
    Shows TCP/UDP listening ports.

### 7. **Dstat**
- **What it is**: `dstat` is a versatile tool that can replace `vmstat`, `iostat`, `netstat`, and others. It provides information on CPU, disk, network, memory, etc., all in one tool.
- **How to install**:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install dstat
  ```
- **How to use**:
  - Type `dstat` in the terminal.
  - Example:
    ```
    dstat -cdngy
    ```
    This shows CPU, disk, network, and memory stats in real-time.

### 8. **Sar (System Activity Report)**
- **What it is**: `sar` collects, reports, and saves system activity information, such as CPU usage, memory, IO, and network activity.
- **How to install**:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install sysstat
  ```
- **How to use**:
  - Type `sar -u` to show CPU usage.
  - Example:
    ```
    sar -u 1 3
    ```
    Shows CPU usage every second, three times.
  - To save logs, use `-o` option.

### 9. **Free**
- **What it is**: `free` displays the amount of free and used memory in the system, including swap space.
- **How to use**:
  - Type `free` in the terminal.
  - Example:
    ```
    free -h
    ```
    This displays memory usage in human-readable format.

### 10. **Lsof (List Open Files)**
- **What it is**: `lsof` lists all open files in the system, including network connections and devices.
- **How to use**:
  - Type `lsof` to list all open files.
  - Example:
    ```
    lsof -i :80
    ```
    Shows all processes using port 80.

### 11. **Ps (Process Status)**
- **What it is**: `ps` is used to display information about running processes.
- **How to use**:
  - Type `ps aux` to show detailed information about all running processes.
  - Example:
    ```
    ps aux | grep process_name
    ```
    This will filter out processes by name.

### 12. **Uptime**
- **What it is**: `uptime` shows how long the system has been running, the number of users, and the system load average.
- **How to use**:
  - Type `uptime` in the terminal.
  - Example:
    ```
    uptime
    ```
    Output will show the time the system has been up, number of users, and load average.

### 13. **Watch**
- **What it is**: `watch` is used to execute a program periodically and display the output.
- **How to use**:
  - Type `watch` followed by a command.
  - Example:
    ```
    watch -n 1 'df -h'
    ```
    This will display disk space usage every second.

### 14. **Glances**
- **What it is**: `glances` is a cross-platform monitoring tool written in Python that shows real-time system stats like CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, and processes.
- **How to install**:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install glances
  ```
- **How to use**:
  - Type `glances` in the terminal.
  - Shows detailed stats in a simple, readable layout.

### 15. **Systemd Journal (journalctl)**
- **What it is**: `journalctl` is used for querying and displaying logs collected by the `systemd` journal service.
- **How to use**:
  - Type `journalctl` to show logs.
  - Example:
    ```
    journalctl -xe
    ```
    Displays logs with errors and warnings.

### 16. **Syslog**
- **What it is**: `syslog` is a standard for logging system events, often used to log messages related to system processes and services.
- **How to use**:
  - Logs are typically found in `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages`.
  - You can use `cat` or `tail` to view logs:
    ```
    tail -f /var/log/syslog
    ```
    Displays real-time log updates.

### 17. **Ntopng**
- **What it is**: `ntopng` is a network monitoring tool that provides a web-based interface to monitor network traffic.
- **How to install**:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install ntopng
