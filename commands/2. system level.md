### **System-Level Commands in Linux**  
System-level commands are essential for managing and monitoring the health, performance, and configuration of a Linux system. Here are the most important commands:  

---

## **1. System Information and Status**  
- **`uname`** – Displays system information.  
  ```bash
  uname -a       # All system info (kernel version, hostname, etc.)
  uname -r       # Kernel version
  uname -m       # Machine hardware name (e.g., x86_64)
  ```
- **`hostname`** – Shows or sets the system hostname.  
  ```bash
  hostname       # Display current hostname
  sudo hostname newhostname  # Temporarily change hostname
  ```
- **`uptime`** – Shows how long the system has been running and load averages.  
  ```bash
  uptime
  ```
- **`dmesg`** – Prints kernel and system boot messages. Useful for debugging hardware issues.  
  ```bash
  dmesg | less
  dmesg | tail  # View the latest messages
  ```
- **`lsb_release`** – Displays Linux distribution information.  
  ```bash
  lsb_release -a
  ```

---

## **2. System Resource Monitoring**  
- **`top`** – Real-time view of system processes, CPU, and memory usage.  
  ```bash
  top
  ```
- **`htop`** – An enhanced version of `top` with a more user-friendly interface (requires installation).  
  ```bash
  htop
  ```
- **`free`** – Displays memory usage.  
  ```bash
  free -h        # Human-readable format
  ```
- **`df`** – Shows disk space usage.  
  ```bash
  df -h          # Human-readable format
  ```
- **`du`** – Checks directory size.  
  ```bash
  du -sh /path/to/directory
  ```
- **`vmstat`** – Displays virtual memory statistics, CPU activity, and system processes.  
  ```bash
  vmstat 5       # Updates every 5 seconds
  ```
- **`iostat`** – Monitors CPU and I/O statistics.  
  ```bash
  iostat -x 5    # Extended statistics, updates every 5 seconds
  ```

---

## **3. Process Management**  
- **`ps`** – Displays information about running processes.  
  ```bash
  ps aux             # List all running processes
  ps -ef | grep process_name  # Search for a specific process
  ```
- **`kill`** – Terminates a process.  
  ```bash
  kill PID           # Graceful termination (SIGTERM)
  kill -9 PID        # Force kill (SIGKILL)
  ```
- **`killall`** – Kills all processes by name.  
  ```bash
  killall process_name
  ```
- **`pkill`** – Kills processes based on matching patterns.  
  ```bash
  pkill -f pattern
  ```
- **`nice` and `renice`** – Adjusts process priority.  
  ```bash
  nice -n 10 command   # Start a command with lower priority
  renice -n 5 -p PID   # Change priority of a running process
  ```

---

## **4. Service Management**  
- **`systemctl`** – Controls system services (for systems using `systemd`).  
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start service_name    # Start a service
  sudo systemctl stop service_name     # Stop a service
  sudo systemctl restart service_name  # Restart a service
  sudo systemctl status service_name   # Check service status
  sudo systemctl enable service_name   # Enable service on startup
  sudo systemctl disable service_name  # Disable service on startup
  ```
- **`service`** – Legacy command for managing services (on older distributions).  
  ```bash
  sudo service service_name start
  sudo service service_name status
  ```

---

## **5. Network Management and Troubleshooting**  
- **`ifconfig`** – Displays or configures network interfaces (older command).  
  ```bash
  ifconfig
  ```
- **`ip`** – Newer alternative to `ifconfig`.  
  ```bash
  ip a               # Show all network interfaces and IP addresses
  ip link set eth0 up  # Bring an interface up
  ip link set eth0 down  # Bring an interface down
  ```
- **`ping`** – Tests network connectivity.  
  ```bash
  ping google.com
  ```
- **`traceroute`** – Traces the path packets take to a destination.  
  ```bash
  traceroute google.com
  ```
- **`netstat`** – Displays network connections, routing tables, and statistics.  
  ```bash
  netstat -tuln     # Show listening ports
  ```
- **`ss`** – Newer and faster alternative to `netstat`.  
  ```bash
  ss -tuln          # Show listening ports
  ```
- **`nslookup`** – DNS lookup.  
  ```bash
  nslookup example.com
  ```
- **`dig`** – More advanced DNS lookup.  
  ```bash
  dig example.com
  ```
- **`iptables`** – Configures firewall rules (requires root).  
  ```bash
  sudo iptables -L   # List firewall rules
  ```

---

## **6. System Startup and Shutdown**  
- **`shutdown`** – Shuts down or restarts the system.  
  ```bash
  sudo shutdown -h now      # Shutdown immediately
  sudo shutdown -r now      # Reboot immediately
  sudo shutdown -h +30      # Shutdown in 30 minutes
  ```
- **`reboot`** – Reboots the system.  
  ```bash
  sudo reboot
  ```
- **`halt`** – Stops the system.  
  ```bash
  sudo halt
  ```
- **`init`** – Changes the system runlevel (older systems).  
  ```bash
  sudo init 0       # Shutdown
  sudo init 6       # Reboot
  ```

---

## **7. Package Management**  
- **For Ubuntu/Debian (apt):**  
  ```bash
  sudo apt update               # Update package list
  sudo apt upgrade               # Upgrade all installed packages
  sudo apt install package_name  # Install a package
  sudo apt remove package_name   # Uninstall a package
  ```
- **For CentOS/Red Hat (yum or dnf):**  
  ```bash
  sudo yum update
  sudo yum install package_name
  sudo yum remove package_name
  ```

---

## **8. System Logs**  
- **`journalctl`** – View system logs (for `systemd` systems).  
  ```bash
  journalctl -xe                # Show recent errors
  journalctl -u service_name    # Logs for a specific service
  journalctl --since "2 hours ago"  # Logs from the last 2 hours
  ```
- **`tail`** – View the end of log files in real-time.  
  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/syslog
  tail -f /var/log/messages     # On CentOS/RedHat
  ```
