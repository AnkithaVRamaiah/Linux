### 2. **System Monitoring Commands:**

These commands help you monitor system performance, processes, and resources.

- **`top`** – Display real-time system processes
  - Shows a list of running processes, their resource usage, and system performance.
  - Usage: `top`
  - Example: Shows processes, CPU, and memory usage.

- **`ps`** – Display running processes
  - Lists the currently running processes.
  - Usage: `ps [options]`
  - Example: `ps aux` (shows detailed information about all running processes).

- **`df`** – Disk space usage
  - Displays the disk space usage for all mounted file systems.
  - Usage: `df [options]`
  - Example: `df -h` (shows disk space in a human-readable format).

- **`du`** – Disk usage of files or directories
  - Shows the disk usage of files or directories.
  - Usage: `du [options] [directory]`
  - Example: `du -sh /home/user/` (shows the total disk usage of the specified directory).

- **`free`** – Memory usage
  - Displays system memory (RAM) usage, including free and used memory.
  - Usage: `free [options]`
  - Example: `free -h` (shows memory usage in a human-readable format).

- **`uptime`** – System uptime
  - Displays how long the system has been running since the last reboot.
  - Usage: `uptime`
  - Example: `uptime` (e.g., 10:00:01 up 5 days, 3:15, 2 users, load average: 0.08, 0.12, 0.11).

- **`htop`** – Interactive process viewer
  - Similar to `top`, but with a more user-friendly, interactive interface.
  - Usage: `htop`
  - Example: Shows running processes and resource usage with color-coded data.

- **`vmstat`** – System performance
  - Provides information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, and CPU activity.
  - Usage: `vmstat [interval] [count]`
  - Example: `vmstat 1 5` (shows system stats every 1 second for 5 times).

- **`iostat`** – CPU and I/O statistics
  - Provides statistics about CPU and disk input/output performance.
  - Usage: `iostat [options]`
  - Example: `iostat -x 1` (shows extended stats every 1 second).

- **`netstat`** – Network statistics
  - Displays information about network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, etc.
  - Usage: `netstat [options]`
  - Example: `netstat -tuln` (shows active listening ports).

- **`ping`** – Test network connectivity
  - Sends packets to a target host to check network connectivity.
