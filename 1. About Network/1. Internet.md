### **1. What is the Internet?**  
The **internet is a network of computers** that talk to each other. Your computer or phone connects to this network through an **Internet Service Provider (ISP)** like Jio, Airtel, or BSNL.

### **2. How Does It Work? (Step by Step)**
Letâ€™s say you want to visit **Google.com** on your phone. Here's what happens:  

âœ… **Step 1: You type "www.google.com" in your browser**  
- Your phone doesn't understand "google.com"; it needs an **IP address** (a unique number like `142.250.183.206`) to find Googleâ€™s computer.  

âœ… **Step 2: DNS Converts Name to IP Address**  
- The **Domain Name System (DNS)** works like a phonebook. It looks up the IP address of Googleâ€™s server and gives it to your phone.  

âœ… **Step 3: Your Request Travels Through the Internet**  
- Your phone **sends a request** to Googleâ€™s server, asking for the homepage.  
- This request **travels through wires, Wi-Fi, or mobile data** and passes through **routers** (like traffic signals) to reach Googleâ€™s computer.  

âœ… **Step 4: Google Sends Data Back to You**  
- Googleâ€™s server receives your request, processes it, and **sends back the webpage in small pieces called packets**.  
- These packets travel through the internet and reach your phone.  

âœ… **Step 5: Your Browser Displays the Page**  
- Your phone puts the packets together and shows Googleâ€™s homepage.  

ðŸ’¡ **In short:** Your request â†’ Travels through the internet â†’ Reaches Google â†’ Google sends a response â†’ You see the webpage!

### **3. The Internet is Like a Postal System**  
Imagine you send a **letter** to your friend:  
ðŸ“© **You write their name (google.com) â†’ Post office (DNS) finds the address â†’ Letter travels through different routes (routers) â†’ Friend receives it and sends a reply.**  

The internet works the same way, but instead of letters, we send **data packets**!

### **4. What Makes the Internet Work?**
The internet uses special rules called **protocols**:  
- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Gives every device a unique address.  
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Ensures data reaches safely.  
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Helps load web pages securely.

### **Conclusion**  
The internet is a big network where computers talk to each other using rules. Your requests travel through servers, routers, and cables, just like letters moving through a postal system.
